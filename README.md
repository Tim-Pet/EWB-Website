# EWB Website
This is a private project for a friend in order to improve my knowledge and designing approach of websites. 


## To Do
- Add Form
- Media Queries for Mobile
- Clamp small text
- Add Parallax 
- Animate Text in sidebar
- Add Scroll indicator
- Add Navbar that appears when scrolled down to last page
- Add animated icons

## Support welcome for:
- Any advice is welcome anytime (!) but if someone would ask about my struggles here we go
- Change Dream Section into a parallax section. 
  - The 'big Text' should scroll slower than the 'small text' (This is just an example to learn how things work without setting up x scrolllistener & scroll  trigger)
  - Spring example is following asap and linked here later on
- Improvement of template
- Improvement of my currently more or less hardcoded scrollTrigger which only work as intended since the sections are 100vh each
- Repair resize eventListener in index.js

## Comments
- Ignore SVGs for now, they are going to get implemented later in the process
