# EWB Website
This is a private project for a friend in order to improve my knowledge and designing approach of websites. 


## To Do
- Add Form
- Media Queries for Mobile
- Clamp small text
- <del>Add Parallax</del> 
- Animate Text in sidebar
- Add Scroll indicator
- Add Navbar that appears when scrolled down to last page
- Add animated icons

## Support welcome for:
- Any advice is welcome anytime (!) but if someone would ask about my struggles here we go
- Change Sections into a parallax section. 
  - The 'big Text' should scroll slower than the 'small text' (This is just an example to learn how things work without setting up x scrolllistener & scroll  trigger)
  - Spring example --> move to localhost:8000/parallax to see an example of implemented React-Spring-Parallax
  - Since React-Spring Parallax breaks the layout (forces position: absolute) another approach is used with scrollListeners. Further improvements welcome
- Suggestions for better "templating"
- Improvement of my currently more or less hardcoded scrollTrigger which only work as intended since the sections are 100vh each
- Repair resize eventListener in index.js

## Comments
- Ignore SVGs for now, they are going to get implemented later in the process
